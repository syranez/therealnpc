As IDE: scrolloffset
====================

When you normally scroll your cursor, it will soon become the first or last line in the visible area. Thus you can not see both context sides of a cursor line, only the above or the context below the cursor.

So two questions:

  1) How do I get x lines of context?
  2) How do I get a vertically centered cursor line?

1. vim

        1) (ESC) :set scrolloff=x

        2) (ESC) :set scrolloff=9999

1. emacs

        Y U CAN'T BE AWESOME?!

1. nano

        Y U CAN'T BE AWESOME?!

1. sed

        Y U CAN'T BE AWESOME?!
