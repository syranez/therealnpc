The real npc
============

Shows how emacs and vim users solve challenges.

Nomenclature
------------

Emacs keybindings are written as C-M-S-x. C is Control, M is Meta, S is Shift. Lowercase characters mean "press this key".

Searching in vim is triggered by /, then enter the search string and return.

Vim has modes (command, insert, visual). Vim users have to press keys to switch modes. Many modes can be implicit activated by triggering some command. However to escape from insert or view mode to command mode hit

        ESC

To got into insert mode hit

        i

and for visual mode press

        v

therealpnc trys to show which keys have to pressed to solve a challenge, thus your solutions have to have *all* needed key strokes! However the leading ESC of any command to insurance the command is executed in command mode is optional. However if you want to express it in your solutions use the

        (ESC)

nomenclature.
