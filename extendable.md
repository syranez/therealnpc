Extendable
==========

Both can be extended by plugins.

Very good plugins
-----------------

Fill me

Dependencies
------------

Some plugins use other programs, parse the output and pipes them back to editor. This is common by both - vim and emacs.

Plugins for emacs are written in elisp. Plugins in vim can be written in anything. elisp is available on every system where emacs runs because it is part of it. Vim plugins can have e. g. dependencies to python. Vim then has to be compiled with +python and python has to be available on all systems.
